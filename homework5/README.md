My view on the video
>- This video is so amazing! There are so many things that I can use for my projects. I can even tell write all of them
there were so many of them. Couple of my favourites editor shortcuts were the multi cursor editing in which you can edit multiple
lines of similar code at same time, extracting multiple methods and making them one extract method.
>- Then came the debugging tool. Awesomeness! I love the one where you can set a condition for the debugger to call on.
>- Native C C++ was a little over the top. And I'm probably not gonna use it. Maybe.
>- 20% of the time you code goes in cleaning project, installing project, gradle building. So saving time on gradle?
Yes please!! It's amazing how simple changes can save so much time.
